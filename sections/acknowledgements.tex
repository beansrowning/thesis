  I would like to thank Dr. Sebastian Funk, to whom I owe a great deal for his
  patience and guidance during this project.

  I would also like to thank my family, and partner, Annie, who all provided
  tremendous support throughout the process.

  In loving memory of my late grandmothers, Faye Boyer and Cynthia Browning, both
  of whom passed away during my studies in London. \\
  Through your love, I pursue my dreams.
